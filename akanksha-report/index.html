                                <hr><br>
                                <p class="p3 fw3">Akanksha has always been on a continuous path of learning about the purpose of education in a rapidly changing world. The year 2017-2018 was a year of ‘Looking Ahead’ for all of us. Building on Akanksha’s 27 years of experience during the previous two phases, 1991-2007 when Akanksha ran the after-school centres and 2007-2017 when we transitioned into running 20 schools, we wanted to define what the next decade in Akanksha’s journey would look like. We asked ourselves two fundamental questions:<br><br>
                
                                <span class="fw5">1. What would define excellent education in the coming ten years and hence, what would an Akanksha graduate look like?<br><br>
                                2. How do we further our vision of serving all children?</span><br><br>
                
                                While exploring answers to the above questions, we reached out to all our stakeholders - from the children in our classrooms to the board members of Akanksha. After a year long process, we emerged with a revised mission of Akanksha- to build one of the largest network of innovative schools that empowers children to maximise their potential and that influences systemic reform. As we continue to strengthen our schools and deepen our impact, we have taken a critical look at how we can develop 21st century knowledge, skills and values in our children. This helped us to craft a Student Vision framework that envisions all Akanksha students to graduate with a sense of Mastery, Autonomy and Purpose, empowered with essential knowledge and skills like critical thinking, creativity, collaboration and communication with a deep focus on our core values.<br>
                                    
                                Today, while we are proud of how far our network of schools have reached , we also acknowledge how far we have to go. We believe the learning taking place in each classroom can be more rigorous and fun for each child and needs to be better differentiated to address the diverse needs of all the students in our classrooms.<br>
                                    
                                The School Development Review (SDR) plays a monumental role in achieving this by providing consistent support to our school teams and equipping them with the skills and resources they need, to work with each child and improve their practises. This year we incorporated the Akanksha pillars to the School Development Review for deeper understanding of each school goals. This has surfaced Akanksha’s best practises and brought attention to very specific focus areas, which we would not have realised otherwise.<br>
                                    
                                As we embark on this new phase in Akanksha’s journey our aim will be to build a stronger organisation culture during this time of change that is inclusive, transparent and empowering. We believe that our values will form the foundation for us to work towards the ambitious goals we have in front of us, enjoy the process, learn from our mistakes, take pride in our achievements and innovate for the future.</p>

                            <p class="p3 fw3">Several SMCs identified physical abuse at home as a major issue facing their communities. Akanksha’s Laxmi Nagar School conducted a survey that revealed 87% of students were physically abused at home. The parents in the SMC worked to educate other parents about the impact of physical abuse on children. They surveyed parents on what motivates abuse, and 90% revealed they did not know how to deal with the pressures they face in their own lives.</p><br>
                            <p class="p3 fw3">The school created a plan to identify and support parents in need of help, working with them to develop positive disciplining systems. This year, the rate of abuse was reduced by 40%, and the school’s effort continues.</p><br>
                            <p class="p3 fw3">At Akanksha’s Sitaram Mill School, the SMC worked with a local NGO to run a campaign on child sexual abuse awareness and prevention. The campaign engaged children and parents in their community of 56,000 people through posters, stands, plays and dialogue. The SMC used community cricket games to engage parents, and specifically fathers, in the sexual abuse awareness campaign. More Akanksha SMCs are continuing to start their own campaigns around this issue.</p>
